# EM-Structure-Motif-Finder
An EM algorithm for finding repeated patters in runs of numerical scores

### Score Motifs
Problem: Given a set of numerical sequences, is there some subsequence that is similar in all (or most) of them? For example, given these three sequences:

s1: 5**,8,20,21,20,7,**6,19,7,3,4,6,20
s2: 6,19,8,7,4,2,**,8,21,21,19,8,**20
s3: 10,1,8,2**,9,20,21,20,8,**,20,2,10
